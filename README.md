# Ticket-Sale-Calculator
The manager of a football stadium wants you to write a program that calculates the total ticket sales after each game. There are four categories of tickets â€“ box, sideline, premium and general admission. After each game data is stored in a file in the following format.
Data.txt
categories   ticketPrice    numberOfTicketsSold
box            250                   750
sideline       100                   2800
premium        50                   35750
general        25                    1875


The first line contains columns heading.
The second line indicates the type of the ticket is box, its price is $250 and 750 tickets were sold at that price.

1.	Search the category with the maximum number of tickets sold.
2.	Search the category with the minimum number of tickets sold.
3.	Display only those categories whose total sales exceeds 10,000.
4.	Calculate total number of tickets sold.
